    <h1>CodeNest - Learn to Code the Fun Way</h1>
    <div class="typewriter-wrapper">
        <span id="typewriter"></span>
    </div>
    <p>
        CodeNest started from a dream — a dream to help young people learn how to code in a way that's fun, modern, and
        meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a world where traditional education can often feel boring, repetitive, or disconnected from real-life skills,
        we knew there had to be a better way. We created CodeNest as a playful yet serious alternative — a space where
        curiosity is rewarded, creativity is nurtured, and progress is always visible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our approach isn’t about memorizing syntax — it’s about solving problems, building real projects, and developing
        logical thinking. Whether it’s creating a mini game, building your first webpage, or automating something cool,
        you’ll be learning by doing from day one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you're taking your first steps or you're already passionate about technology, CodeNest is your nest — a
        safe, supportive place to grow into the developer of tomorrow.
